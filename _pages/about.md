I’m Binshuai (Derek) Wang, a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at The George Washington University, advised by Dr. Peng Wei. My research focuses on machine learning, reinforcement learning, and optimization, with an emphasis on robustness, optimal transport theory, and AI safety.

I work on developing mathematically grounded methods for robust machine learning and applying them to real-world problems in aviation decision-making and computer vision model evaluation. My recent work explores vision transformers, distributional shifts, and synthetic data generation for safety-critical applications.

You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page]&#40;/al-folio/publications/&#41; automatically.)
